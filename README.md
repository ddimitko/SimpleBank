# SimpleBank
A simple banking app I am working on for learning purposes.
### Update 1: Accept User Input for the User's name, User's ID, Balance and Main Menu.
### Update 2: You don't need to enter UserID anymore, because the app automatically generates one for you!
### Update 3: Finished, the database, the GUI, and the Login/Signup system!

# Roadmap
