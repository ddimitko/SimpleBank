# SimpleBank
A simple banking app I am working on for learning purposes.
### Update 1: Accept User Input for the User's name, User's ID, Balance and Main Menu.
### Update 2: You don't need to enter UserID anymore, because the app automatically generates one for you!

# Roadmap
1. Save and load user info from a database.
2. Create a Graphical User Interface(GUI).
3. Create a Login and Signup system.
